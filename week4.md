# Introduction/Business Problem  

## Background
The City of Boston is the largest city in Massachusetts with 800,000  inhabitants who travel through the city every day of the year - work, life, pleasure. [1] The inhabitants walk, take mass transit, drive and bicycle to their destinations.  These inhabitants are often joined by metro-area commuters increasing the number of trips taken by the people in boston to: 40,000 bike trips a day, 131,000 drive alone and 1.3 million take transit. [2][3][4]  

From 2016 to 2017, the number of bike trips a day rose from 30,000 to 40,000 trips; similar increases are found in New York City. [5] The increase in the number of cyclists and other metro-area commuters has resulted in *injuries and deaths* for cyclists.[7][8] 

The City of Boston provides raw data related to traffic accidents, neighborhood information and fatalities. There is an opportunity to identify incident hotspots, opportunities to improve street safety, allocate resources, and improve commuter safety. 

## Problem
The raw data from the City of Boston provides insights on the locations of neighborhoods, fatalities and incidents. This project identifies incident hotspots and neighborhoods, and suggests less incident prone neighborhoods of travel for users.  

The project aims to help Boston cyclists be better prepared to travel in the neighborhoods they pass through. Given the appropriate data, the problem is: 
* What level of risk is there in commuting through the Boston neighborhoods and streets to avoid? 

## Audience 
The target audience is cyclists who would benefit from knowing what are the best neighborhoods to commute through. The report improves the understanding a cyclists traveling in boston has for safety, and potentially the better neighborhoods to travel through.  

The report does not distinguish between the individuals who are bicycling for fun, business or on a commute.
